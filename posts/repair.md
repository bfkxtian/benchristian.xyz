&emsp;This right to repair is legislation that allows consumers to freely and openly repair, modify and repurpose products they already own. If you think that's a given liberty already, consider reading on... ü§î

&emsp;It is a strange concept to think that this is not widespread, but a combination of anti-consumer design trends and vertical integration for repair services and components has forced the issue into the public eye. 
There are countless examples of anti-consumer trends that have slowly become more prevalent in the industry, including:

- Flexibility to chose independent repair shops and access to parts and tools for DIY repairs üõ†Ô∏è.
- Right to sideload, unlock and jailbreak software as desired üóùÔ∏è.
- Freedom to reclaim and repurpose components otherwise destined for e-waste üóëÔ∏è.

&emsp;If these suggestions seem a stretch, consider old electronics stores that sourced components, manuals and services for television sets, radios and appliances. 
Imagine a world without independent mechanics or auto-parts stores, relying on dealerships for all repairs and maintenance items on you vehicle, even as simple as an oil change or light bulb replacement. 
Fast forward and modern electronics have trended towards thin and light form factors that make repairs almost impossible even for those with experience in repair.
Electric cars are following the same path and the pricing for batteries, motors and electronics are arbitrarily set by the OEM. 
In fact almost all industries are transitioning to this model, with the primary argument being made for the safety (and security) of the consumer. 
Even general aviation, one of the slowest industries on Earth for the widespread adoption of new technologies is evolving to front electric powertrains, displacing engine and aircraft designs that have been in service for the better part of a century. 

&emsp;The gradual erosion of consumer rights has been overlooked by regulators and the general public for too long.
Unforntunately, there isn't a whole lot that can be done, even with regulation - wheels are already in motion.
The most powerful tool at your disposal (and the greatest desire of all companies) is money üí∞. 
The choices you make as a consumer speak louder than I can, purchasing products that are transparent about repair, security updates and freedom will slowly bring back your rights as a consumers.
Remember, this is only a relatively new issue, and we need to be extremely careful to catch it before it is too late.

&emsp;I implore you to explore and read more about right to repair as it is easily one of the most important digital rights movements alongside the open-source movement that pushes a similar mindset in the software industry.
